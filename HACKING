Building
--------
GNU like systems: After first checkout run `./bootstrap`, `./configure` then `make`. After making changes to the code just run `make` to rebuild.
MS Visual Studio: Open windows/freeserf.sln, build, run or debug.


Coding style
------------
freeserf follows the Linux coding style <http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle> with the following exceptions:

* Lines can be longer than 80 chars (but not much longer).
* All structures are typedef'ed.

See the document above for instructions in setting up your editor to use this indentation style.
